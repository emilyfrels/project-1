**Project Description/Outline:**
Group 7 will be looking at weather statistics for the state of Minnesota to determine if severe weather is trending upward in the past 70 years. We believe severe weather has increased over the years due to Global Warming and from personal experience. 

All of the data in our dataset is considered severe. There are also definitions provided on the NOAA website with numbers corresponding to what is severe, but we will not have to determine this on our end with the data provided.

**Hypothesis:**
Between 1950 and 2020, on average there has been an increase in the number of severe weather instances.

**Null Hypothesis:**
The average number of instances of severe weather between 1950 to 2020 has not changed or has no statistical significance. 

**Research Questions to Answer:**
* Has Minnesota  weather gotten more severe over the years since 1950? 
* Average temperature per season
    * Change between seasons - has change in temperature increased?
    * Has average monthly temperature varied?
* Number of tornadoes experienced in Minnesota?
